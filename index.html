            <p>
                I'm <span style="color: #bc0000">Joseph Arias Jr.</span>, the person behind
                <span style="color: #bc0000">LensBySen</span> and a proud member of <span style="color: #bc0000">JYMZ Films</span>
                <br><br><br>
                Ever since I was a kid, I've always been drawn
                to movies. I used to get lost in the stories, the
                visuals, the emotions, wondering how each
                scene was made and how every shot could
                make people feel something. That early love
                for film slowly grew into a passion for
                photography and videography.
                <br><br><br>
                In <span style="color: #bc0000">2024</span>, during my Grade 12 year, I worked on
                a short film titled <span style="color: #bc0000">"The Missing Note of My Heart,"</span>
                which earned me the <span style="color: #bc0000;">Best in Cinematography Award.</span>
                That moment was a turning point. It made me realize that telling stories
                through lens wasn't just something I loved, it was something I was meant to do.
                <br><br><br>
                Now, through <span style="color: #bc0000">LensBySen</span>, I focus on
                capturing real and meaningful moments,  
                whether it's a festival, an event, or a simple
                scene with a powerful story behind it. Every
                frame I shoot is a piece of that childhood
                dream brought to life.

                                Back in Grade 11, I joined my school's photography club. 
                                At the time, I didn't even own a camera. I just knew I enjoyed taking photos. 
                                In December 2022, the school organized a photo exhibit to showcase the club's talent. 
                                I was stressed because I had no idea what to submit and felt unprepared. 
                                That's when I remembered a photo I took of a shark during a family visit to Ocean Park beside SM Seaside. 
                                I captured it using only my Vivo Y31 phone.
                                <br><br>
                                With no better option, I submitted that shark photo. Before the event, we had a meeting and were asked to confirm that our photos were original and not taken from the internet. 
                                When someone in charge asked who took the shark photo, I nervously raised my hand, thinking something was wrong. 
                                To my surprise, they started asking me more about it, not because it was bad, but because they were impressed. 
                                They told me that sharks play a big role in biodiversity and that my photo carried meaning. I was shocked. 
                                That moment gave me a small but powerful boost of confidence.
                                <br><br>
                                On December 17, 2022, the exhibit was held at SM Seaside with the theme Photography and Biodiversity. 
                                That day completely changed how I saw myself as a creator. Professional photographers from around the country were there, including Ms. Jacqueline Hernandez, a photojournalist from Rappler. 
                                While guests were viewing the photos, I noticed her walking toward mine. I was filming the moment and she caught me. 
                                She smiled, asked if the shark photo was mine, and when I told her I took it using just a phone, she simply said, "Good job."
                                <br><br>
                                It may have been just two words, but for me, it meant everything.
                                <br><br>
                                From that moment on, I started taking my passion more seriously. I realized that gear doesn't define talent and that even the simplest photo, 
                                if it tells a story, can leave an impact. That experience gave me the confidence I needed to keep going. It was the start of something bigger.

                                After the photo exhibit in 2022, I started taking on small projects like debut shoots, 
                                even without my own camera. I borrowed gear from a good friend, Joyce Ann, and continued practicing. 
                                In November 2023, during my Grade 12 finals and on my birthday, our class was given a major project: 
                                to create a short film. I had been waiting for a chance like this for a long time. I took on the role 
                                of videographer and editor, and even though we didn't have any professional equipment, we made it 
                                happen with the help of my classmates and close friends — Matt, Gellah, and Mitch, who also built 
                                this website.
                                <br><br>
                                Our film was shot using just two iPhones and edited entirely on CapCut using my Vivo Y31, the same 
                                phone I used to take the shark photo back in Grade 11. By December, things became more stressful. 
                                The school kept changing the deadlines and instructions, which made us rush our shoots. We only had 
                                about a month to work on everything, while also dealing with other school subjects like research. 
                                I didn't even attend the Christmas Party because I stayed home editing the film. Despite all that, 
                                we pushed through with teamwork and a lot of effort.
                                <br><br>
                                In early January 2024, our short film was screened during the school's film showing. Each class had 
                                its own booth, and our tickets sold out every day. It felt great hearing people say how much they enjoyed 
                                it. Some even walked out with tears in their eyes, which meant a lot since our film combined romance, 
                                comedy, action, and mystery.
                                <br><br>
                                Even though I was proud of what we made, I really thought we had no chance of winning any awards. 
                                Other sections used professional cameras with gimbals, and we didn't even follow all the rules set by 
                                the film festival. So when January 31 came and it was time to announce the winners, I kept my expectations 
                                low. We didn't win Best Film in Media Ethics, which I already expected. But then they announced the Best 
                                Cinematography award, and to my surprise, our film was called. My friends and I shouted. Matt gave me a 
                                push and said, "Go get your trophy!" I walked up to the stage, heart pounding, and accepted the first 
                                award I had ever received for something I truly loved doing. My friends told me to keep the trophy, and 
                                now it's displayed at home.
                                <br><br>
                                That moment meant everything to me. It recognized the effort and emotion I poured into each frame. 
                                It's wild to think that a project given on my birthday became such a big moment in my life. I never 
                                imagined something shot on phones and edited on a budget device could be recognized. It reminded me 
                                of why I started, and how much I love telling stories through visuals.
                                <br><br>
                                This whole experience made me take my passion more seriously. It showed me that with hard work, 
                                creativity, and support from friends, you don't need fancy tools to create something meaningful. 
                                It wasn't just a school project. It was a turning point that gave me confidence to keep going.

                                On the final days of my first year in college, my friend Nathaniel invited me to join him and Joshua, 
                                who was building a creative team focused on event videography like festivals, weddings, and more. Joshua 
                                already had experience and a long-time client who trusted him with projects like videos for festival 
                                queens. It sounded exciting, but I turned it down. I didn't own a camera, and I wasn't confident working 
                                in a team setting. Back when we did our short film in high school, I was the one who took all the videos 
                                and edited them, but I was still working within the comfort of a familiar environment. This was different. 
                                I knew everyone in the team loved doing the same thing, and I was afraid I wouldn't meet expectations.
                                <br><br>
                                Later, after finishing my first year and while I was looking for a job that aligned with my passion, 
                                Nathaniel reached out again. This time, they had an upcoming project on Olango Island to produce a video 
                                for the Butong Festival in Barangay Sabang. I felt torn. I wanted to join but still doubted if I was ready. 
                                I thought about it deeply for days, talked to my parents, and finally accepted the offer. We began planning 
                                and held meetings to discuss ideas and shot lists.
                                <br><br>
                                Before the trip, we held planning meetings to prepare our shots and angles. On June 7, 2025, we met Joshua's 
                                client and their team at the port. They were event organizers and treated us very well, always making sure 
                                we were comfortable. To cover more angles, we rented a second camera since Joshua already had one. There were 
                                four of us in the team: Joshua, Nathaniel, me, and Joshua's cousin, also named Joseph, who handled photography. 
                                We traveled to Olango by boat and stayed there for two days. Day one focused on portrait shoots for the 
                                festival queens, and day two was for a jingle music video with the barangay officials. After wrapping up, 
                                we went home by boat.
                                <br><br>
                                The second session took place on June 27. We came back to capture the actual Butong Festival and edit a 
                                Same-Day Edit (SDE) video. The place was packed, vibrant, and full of energy. Me, Nathaniel, and Joshua's 
                                cousin handled capturing the moments while Joshua focused on editing. We worked until late at night and 
                                slept there before going home the next morning. It was my first real job, and even though we were tired, 
                                it was all worth it. We had fun doing what we love.
                                <br><br>
                                It was the first time we all worked together as a team, and now we're trying to make it official. Joshua 
                                named the team JYMZ Films. I now help Joshua manage the team's page while also managing my own. 
                                It was truly the start of something new.
